## Hi ðŸ‘‹

This is a privacy focused bitcoin curriculum. Material is currently divided in 5 sections and still under development. Each section includes list of curated resources to be digested by the participants. Sections also include supporting material like programming exercises, tools, quotes, news articles  etc. Discussion questions are included in the sections as well. Most of the questions are aimed to explore trade-offs, some are designed to assess one's understanding of the concepts and vocabulary and many don't really have right answers. Therefore, fell free to philosophize, go off on tangents, contradict yourselves and play the devil's advocate. Participants are also encouraged to produce their own questions from the material and suggest additional resources and topics. For any inquiries, feedback or suggestions, you can contact me at iam[at]ataniz.com
