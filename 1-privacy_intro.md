## discussion questions

- who are these cypherpunks? what are their values?

- how confident are you, that the information you provide to third parties won't be shared/sold/leaked?

- Should individuals have the power to determine for themselves when, how and for what purpose their personal information is handled? How can this power be claimed where replication of such information is so cheap and demand is so high?

- how does anonymity relate to privacy?
  
- Is privacy relevant for bitcoin? why?

- If you don't have [anything to hide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument), why do you care about privacy?

- Is "security as a collective goal" a valid reason to violate "individuals privacy"? 

- Is privacy different from secrecy? what is the difference?
  
- Could one attain privacy only by oneself? Is it possible to talk about anonymity without a "crowd"? 

- How does usability of technologies relate to privacy?

- How does the focus of evaluating privacy differ from confidentiality (and information security)?[^1]
<!-- this question related to the differentiation of information security from privacy -->

- What are the benefits and drawbacks of using one's real name, a pseudonym, or an anonymous identity? (consistency of the identity, difficulty of doxing, optional disclosure)

- what are the differences between covert and overt actions? Why would be one preferable to the other?

- Is there any value in designing open, transparent system? Is privacy always a feature, is openness always a vulnerability?

- What are the implications of lack of privacy for the individual and for the society?

- What is fungibility? Why is it a valued property of money? what other properties would be desirable?
  <!-- - What are the prerequisites for censorship? -->

- Is Bitcoin fungible? How does fungibility relate to censorship resistance?

- Is it possible to have a functioning free market without providing individuals with good privacy guarantees for their economic actions? How can economic actors compete while everyone can 'see each other hands'?

- Looking at crypto anarchist manifesto after 30 years. Are the projections of Tim May mapping to today's reality? 

- why is there such a big market for user data? what are the use cases for such data?

> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary inter­fer­ence with his privacy, family, home or corre­spon­dence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputa­tion. Everyone has the right to the protec­tion of the law against such inter­fer­ence or attacks.
\- Article 12, United Nations Decla­ra­tion of Human Rights


> The foundation is being laid for a dossier society, in which computers could be used to infer individuals’ life-styles, habits, whereabouts, and associations from data collected in ordinary consumer transactions. Uncertainty about whether data will remain secure against abuse by those maintaining or tapping it can have a `chilling effect,’ causing people to alter their observable activities. 
\- David Chaum: Security without Identification: transaction systems to make big brother obsolete. CACM 1985

>"open society a society in which an individual is confronted with personal decisions" 
\-popper

>    “Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.”
\- Edward Snowden
