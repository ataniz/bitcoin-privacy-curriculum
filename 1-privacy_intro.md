Idea for this section is to introduce relevant history and vocabulary and motivate the audience to think about the value of privacy (mainly internet) and implications of not having it.

## discussion questions

- What is an "open society"?

  <!-- >"a society in which an individual is confronted with personal decisions" 
  \-popper -->

- Take two societies, in one individual is burdened by the responsibility of making personal decisions and suffering

<!-- - Why does privacy matter? -->

- If you don't have [anything to hide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument), why do you care about privacy?

- What are the implications of lack of privacy for the individual and for the society?

- Is "security as a collective goal" a valid reason to violate "individuals right for privacy"? 

- Is privacy different from secrecy?
  
- Could one attain privacy only by oneself? Is it possible to talk about anonymity without a "crowd"? 

- How does usability of technologies relate to privacy? Why are most messaging and emailing apps still don't support E2E encryption?

- What is fungibility? Why is it a valued property of money? Does it really matter?
  <!-- - What are the prerequisites for censorship? -->

- Is Bitcoin fungible? How does fungibility relate to censorship resistance?

- How does privacy differ from confidentiality? What are the differences between the scenarios under which they are relevant?

- What are the benefits and drawbacks of using one's real name, a pseudonym, or an anonymous identity?

- what are the differences between covert and overt actions? Why would be one preferable to the other?

- Is there any value in designing open, fully transparent system? Is privacy always a feature, is openness always a vulnerability?

- Is privacy more important than auditability, should there be a trade-off between the two?

>The foundation is being laid for a dossier society, in which computers could be used to infer individuals’ life-styles, habits, whereabouts, and associations from data collected in ordinary consumer transactions. Uncertainty about whether data will remain secure against abuse by those maintaining or tapping it can have a `chilling effect,’ causing people to alter their observable activities.
