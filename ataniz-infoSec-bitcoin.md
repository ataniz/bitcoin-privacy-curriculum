how does idea of checks and balances apply to bitcoin?


*make the case for "money as an information system" (without diverging)
evaluate bitcoin under fundamental aspects of InfoSec*


>“Even when money seemed to be material treasure, heavy in pockets and ships' holds and bank vaults, it always was information. Coins and notes, shekels and cowries were all just short-lived technologies for tokenizing information about who owns what.”
\- James Gleick, The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood 

>“In a free market economic system, prices are knowledge, and the signals that communicate information. Prices are not simply a tool to allow capitalists to profit; they are the information system of economic production, communicating knowledge across the world and coordinating the complex processes of production.”
\- Saifedean Ammous, Bitcoin Standard

>"The peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess. The economic problem of society is thus not merely a problem of how to allocate “given” resources—if “given” is taken to mean given to a single mind which deliberately solves the problem set by these “data.” It is rather a problem of how to secure the best use of resources known to any of the members of society, for ends whose relative importance only these individuals know. Or, to put it briefly, it is a problem of the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality." 
\- Frederick Hayek, The Use of Knowledge in Society, "Local knowledge problem"



Money as store of value, unit of account or unit of the information signal that enables large scale efficient economic allocation; all these descriptions point to the conception of money as an information system. This conception of money maps particularly well to bitcoin. Blockchain is essence a p2p network for data storage and Bitcoin protocol defines the set rules through which nodes interact with each other and with this information. If any group of entities is to rely on a such information system for economic coordination, it must be made sure that this information system has sound bases from the perspective of information security. 

### Integrity

>What is integrity? why should I care?

Data Integrity is preserved in Bitcoin network 
- blockchain data structure
- hash functions SHA-256
- mining PoW randomness
- difficuilty adjustment - adapting to the envirenment
- easy verifiability 
- scripting for authorization
- limited total supply rule
  - protection against debasement

### Availability

>what is availability? why should I care?

availability
- number of replicas
- low cost of running a node
- network latency
- tools for light clients
- cencorship resistance

### non-repudiation

via digital signitures 

### confidentiality


what is confidentiality?

"Confidentiality controls protect against the unauthorized use of information. Where 
privacy rights of the individuals dictate the type of authorization granted to information."

confidentiality implies a power asymetry. There is a 
lack of anonymity and trust in the centralized entity

    confidentiality context implies that there is a "trusted" entity that has your information and defines the conditions unders which this information could be disclosed.

  



    example: research - privacy rights - anonimized trials - PII - doxing

    in Bitcoin blockchain everyone is auhorized to read. But to write, one has to use the keys of the spending adresses to generate a valid transaction. That being said the b 
    
    Bitcoin makes it individuals own responsibility to adopt practices in order to protect their privacy. Bitcoin calls for vigilance! We have grown reliant on technologies that provided us free services  

memes: "Don't trust, verify", "not your keys not your coins"


anonimity
>in the internet nobody knows youre a dog<

fungibility  also becomes relevant in this context

>Privacy is about people knowing who you are but not knowing what you are doing.

>Anonymity is about people knowing what you are doing but not knowing who you are.

Connect confidentiality to privacy.

Make the case for caring about privacy.
