>a cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.

"No security by obscurity"

>The universe believes in encryption. [..] Strong cryptography can resist an unlimited application of violence. No amount of coercive force will ever solve a math problem.
    [quote from Julian Assange](https://cryptome.org/2012/12/assange-crypto-arms.htm)

>But we discovered something. Our one hope against total domination. A hope that with courage, insight and solidarity we could use to resist. A strange property of the physical universe that we live in. The universe believes in encryption. It is easier to encrypt information than it is to decrypt it. We saw we could use this strange property to create the laws of a new world.71

Similarly, Edward Snowden writes:72

>In words from history, let us speak no more of faith in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of cryptography.73
