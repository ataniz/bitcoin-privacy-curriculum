                        privacy?


### Tips for question formulation



The best discussion questions explore a trade-off. They have no correct answer but force you to consider each side

Anything that has a specific answer isnâ€™t usually that useful 
-> I still see value in covering main vocabulary/terms using specific direct questions, but they are not really aimed towards discussion but more to make sure everyone is on the same page
