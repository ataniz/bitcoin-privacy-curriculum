This section aims to introduce quantifiable metrics and methods for evaluating/modeling privacy. These metrics and methods will be later applied to bitcoin context. Section also consideres the neccesity of usability for privacy technologies and argues that it is not a single player game.

## discussion questions
---

- k-anonimity paper demonstrates the strength of quasi identifiers at deanonymizing individuals. Considering the effectiveness of deanonimization attacks and regularity of data leaks and sales that make more information available for attackers, how does one make the case for the (anonymized?) publication of information such as medical records, housing, usage data etc. ? (also consider the value it provides, on can consider methods of anonymizing data as well as necessity for open consent for the release)

- What inferences can an outside observer make about an individual by looking at their economic activities?
    
- is k-anonimity model applicable to bitcoin transactions?

- what information can an entropic model infer looking at a bitcoin transaction and its inputs/outputs?
